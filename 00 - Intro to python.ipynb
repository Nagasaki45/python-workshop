    "[Python 3 is better than python 2 in any sense](http://blog.tomgurion.me/migrating-to-python3.html). Use python 2 only if you are going to use a library that doesn't support python 3. The only one I can think of is the python API for the Leap motion. [Here is the python 3 readiness for the 360 most popular python libraries](http://py3readiness.org/). If you decide to use python 2, [you'll stop getting updates soon](https://python3statement.org/).\n",
