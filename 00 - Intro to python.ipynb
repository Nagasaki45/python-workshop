    "# Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python 3\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is easy to learn.\n",
    "- It lets you concentrate on solving your problems, instead of abstract computer science concepts or low level details.\n",
    "- It has a great ecosystem and great community.\n",
    "- It is used all over, especially for data analysis (and web, and scripts, and many other things).\n",
    "\n",
    "### When not to use python 3?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 3 is better than python 2 in any sense, but it's backwards incompatible. Use python 2 only if you know for sure that you are going to use a library that doesn't support python 3. The only one I can think of is the python API for the Leap motion. [Here is the python 3 readiness for the 360 most popular python libraries](http://py3readiness.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Anaconda\n",
    "\n",
    "A python distribution that comes with all of the scientific libraries pre-installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "It's an interactive notebook! Express your thoughts, write your code, and inspect the output, all in one place."
